                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    "Exposing Zalando" is an online campaign dedicated to publicizing alleged discriminatory and racist practices within Zalando, a major German e-commerce company. The campaign focuses on what it describes as Islamophobia and anti-Palestine sentiment plaguing the company's higher ranks, aiming to raise awareness among customers, shareholders, and employees to empower the latter to resist infringements on their civil rights.

                <!-- Culture of Fear Sub-section -->
                <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Culture of Fear</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Zalando is accused of fostering a "toxic, fear-driven work culture". Studies have pointed to an abnormally high employee churn rate compared to the German tech industry average. This environment is particularly severe for employees from immigrant backgrounds, especially Arabs and Muslims, whose visa dependency on their employment creates a power imbalance favoring the company. One in four senior professionals at Zalando are reportedly "actively looking" for other positions, with an average job change time span of less than a year for senior professionals, compared to over two years in the industry.

                <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Systemic Repression of Pro-Palestine Speech</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Since October 7, 2023, Zalando has allegedly employed "discriminatory tactics to repress, intimidate, and silence employees on the basis of their solidarity with the Palestinian cause and their activism against the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza".
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li>**"Individual Cases" Narrative:** Zalando's management reportedly dismisses these incidents as "individual cases that do not warrant comments". However, testimonies suggest a "systemic, premeditated, concerted and organized effort to intimidate employees out of their Palestinian solidarity".</li>
                        <li>**Internal Reporting and Threats:** Employees who expressed support for Palestine have reportedly been reported internally via whistleblower channels, with "uncomfortable" cited as a reason. Employees are pressured to remove Palestinian symbolism, such as the watermelon emoji, under threat of dismissal, framed as ensuring "Jewish employees in Zalando...feel safe". This repression is often directed at the same groups demonized by rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany.</li>
                        <li>**Fear of Retaliation:** Employees, including those personally affected by events in Gaza, have expressed fear of retaliation from Zalando for speaking out. Some employees, particularly those on work visas, face the threat of losing their residency if they contest wrongful termination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Allegations of Anti-Semitism and Genocide Support Sub-section -->
                <div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
                    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Allegations of Anti-Semitism and Genocide Support</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The campaign asserts that Zalando's actions demonstrate support for genocide and that the company "weaponized the deeply antisemitic conflation of the apartheid state of Israel with the religion of Judaism as a false justification for their repression of Palestine solidarity".
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li>**Banning Palestinian Symbols:** Zalando allegedly bans the sale of items featuring the Keffiyeh pattern, a core symbol of Palestinian and Arabic identity, branding it as an "offensive item." This is interpreted as an attempt to demonize the Palestinian identity itself.</li>
                        <li>**Erasure of Palestinian Identity:** The campaign points to the absence of support or even mention of "Palestine" in Zalando's official communications, suggesting an effort to erase Palestinian identity.</li>
                        <li>**Exploitation of Jewish Employees:** The campaign accuses Zalando of "exploiting" a "racist fetishization of Jews" as a "propagandic mechanism to violate freedom of expression and crush political dissent". This is further highlighted by the statement that "Jewish people are being used to destroy democracy" and that "German elites (e.g., Zalandoâ€™s management) scapegoat Jews (yet again) for their own political agendas".</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The campaign also criticizes Zalando's management decisions, viewing them as irrational and damaging to the company's brand and bottom line, suggesting they are driven by "personal political ideology" rather than maximizing shareholder value.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li>**Customer Base Vulnerability:** Zalando, as a consumer brand, is highly sensitive to controversy and public perception, and its customer base is less loyal than those of other tech companies due to abundant competition.</li>
                        <li>**Shareholder Ties to Zionism:** The campaign points to Zalando's major shareholders, BlackRock Inc. and Anders Holch Povlsen, suggesting their financial ties might explain the company's "staunch anti-Palestine posture". Povlsen has notably invested in Israeli fashion retailer Terminal X. Additionally, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has a reputation for being close to large corporations due to his former role as chairman of the supervisory board of BlackRock's German branch, has shown a "staunch Zionist inclination".</li>

                        <li>All respondents reported feeling unsafe after reading the Management Board's statement concerning Palestine.</li>
                        <li>All described the statement as anti-Palestinian, Islamophobic, or both.</li>
                        <li>78% considered the Zalando workplace to have Islamophobic tendencies and biases.</li>
                        <li>Employees expressed "strong anger & resentment," feeling that they are "not treated equally" and no longer trusting most people in the company, especially those in managerial roles. Some feel "oppressed" and forced to "walk on eggshells" to avoid losing their jobs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
